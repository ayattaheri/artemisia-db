# Artemisia Database Development

This repository contains the Bash and R scripts used for the bioinformatic analysis and data processing in the development of the **Artemisia database**. The project covers a comprehensive workflow, from transcriptome assembly to functional annotation and quality control.

The scripts are designed for use on a **high-performance computing (HPC) cluster** and include **SLURM job submission headers**. Please note that **all file paths and names are placeholders** and must be updated to match your specific computational environment.
